# Lab 2 - FTS Operations

## Lab Overview

The goal of this lab is to create the logic to enable searching for products by utilizing Couchbase’s Node.js SDK to perform full text search (FTS) operations and return multiple documents based on FTS results.   See SDK documentation for details on FTS operations.

### Step 1: Add Logic to API

>**Documentation:**  SDK documentation on full text search can be found [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/nodejs-sdk/current/howtos/full-text-searching-with-sdk.html).

>:exclamation:**IMPORTANT:**:exclamation: The K/V get operation result object contains the document along with some other metadata.  For purposes of this lab, and all other labs, only the document contents should be returned.  Therefore, upon a successful get operation, result.value is what should be returned.

*searchProducts()* input:
- product:  string - search term to use on products
- fuzziness:  integer between 0 and 2

*searchProducts()* output:
- error object, if applicable
- products:  array - product documents found in search

See the following code snippet below for a possible implementation of the *searchProducts()* method.  This, or a similar solution, can be used to implement the *searchProducts()* method logic.  

>:exclamation:**REMEMBER:**  Either comment out or replace the NOP line of code ( e.g. ```callback(null, “NOP”)``` ) with the new code created in the lab.

```javascript
  async searchProducts(product, fuzziness) {
    try {
      /**
       * Lab 2:  Search operation (FTS)
       *  1.  FTS:
       *        term query w/ fuzziness
       *        use "basic-search" as index name for searchQuery
       *  2.  K/V getMulti() using FTS results
       *
       */

      let result = await this.cluster.searchQuery(
        "basic-search",
        couchbase.SearchQuery.term(product).fuzziness(fuzziness),
        {
          limit: 100,
        }
      );

      let docIds = result.rows.map((hit) => hit.id);
      //uncomment to see doc count
      // outputMessage(
      //   docIds.length,
      //   "repository.js:searchProducts() - total docs:"
      // );
      let results = await Promise.all(
        docIds.map((id) => {
          return this.collection.get(id);
        })
      );
      return { products: results.map((res) => res.value), error: null };
    } catch (err) {
      //Optional - add business logic to handle error types
      outputMessage(err, "repository.js:searcProducts() - error:");
      return { products: null, error: err };
    }
  }
```

Notes about the code:
- Uses aysnc/await syntax
- Lines 11 - 17:  Running a search query with the following parameters.  Search operations are done at the cluster level for 3.x SDKs.
    + The FTS index to use (this is an index with Couchbase Server)
    + The type of search query to use
    + Limiting the results
- Line 19:  Get a list of product document Ids based on the search results
- Lines 25-29:  Using the Promises API to do a bulk get operation to get all the product documents returned from the search
- Line 30: returning product documents found through search
- *outputMessage()*:  a helper method used to easily print out information to the console, method can be found in the /library directory (see API’s project structure detailed in the [Appendix](#nodejs-api-project-structure))
- try/catch & err object handling is purposefully done in a generic fashion.  The lab participant is free to add logic accordingly to test out various methods of handling errors.
- If you would like to uncomment and test the outputMessage() code blocks, remember that that output will be visible in the console logs.  Run ```docker logs api``` to view it.

Once complete, make sure the *repository.js* file is saved.  Since the API *Docker* container maps to the API’s working directory, any updates made to the API code should be reflected in the container.  Once the code has been saved, the product search functionality should be active within the web UI.   Follow the steps below to verify the *searchProducts()* logic.

1. Go to
2. If not logged in:
    - In the top right corner, click the *Hello* next to the user icon, and a drop down menu should appear.
    - In the drop down menu, click *Sign In*, the web UI should redirect to the *Login* page.
    - Enter username and password credentials
    - Click *Login*
    - After logging in, the web UI should redirect to the *Home* page.  Go to step #3
3. If not at the *Home* page (i.e. the search box isn’t showing)
4. Enter a product in the *search box* and click the *magnifying glass* to run the search.
    - Example search term: shirt
5. If products exist that match the search term the products will display on the screen (see image below).
